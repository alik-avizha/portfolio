Hi, I'm Aleksandr Avizha
https://alik-avizha.github.io/portfolio

I'm a Front-end developer with 1+ year of development experience in creating SPAs based on React, Redux, and TypeScript. My focus is on user interface design and testing and debugging processes. However, I'm not stopping there and am always looking to learn more, so I plan to expand my knowledge and skills towards React-Native, Angular, and Vue.js. Additionally, I am constantly improving my English and participating in Codewars katas in my spare time. I am open to new opportunities and willing to consider your offer!
